# Pandas-cheat-sheet
python pandas library cheat sheet I made in Jupyter notebook (with examples)

following Kevin Markham's (of Data School youtube channel) video tutorials [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5ICCsgW1MxlZ0Hq8LL5U3u9y)

the data set used as example was downloaded from [humdata.org](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/catalog-of-earthquakes1970-2014/resource/10ac8776-5141-494b-b3cd-bf7764b2f964)
